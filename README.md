# GitHub App Challenge üêô

This is a side project to deepen my knowledge in iOS development, with the help of Devpass. This is an iOS app which integrates with GitHub API to show a user's repository list, with navigation to a repository's details. During the Dev Sprint, we also follow good practices of both Git flow and Agile development.
